## Known Bugs

-   I could not find a way to properly drop steam api client and stopping the game from steam application (even when game is not actually open) causes this application to close and also if game is running and you close the application unexpected things can occur but i have not found any particular problem with this yet.

## Planned Improvements

*There are some advanced features under consideration; however, since I don't currently have a need for them myself, Iâ€™d only look into adding them if there's sufficient interest or feedback from users.*

This mod manager "should" support wider range of Total War titles but i don't have them so if you want those games to be supported you can ask to be a tester for it.

## For Developers

Install packages

```sh
bun install
```

Start the Tauri app

```sh
bun tauri dev
```

Build the Tauri app

> You need Steam API SDK files. steamworks-rs dynamically loads without any manual setup while in development mode but for bundling you would want to put those files in ./src-tauri. There is also schema files thats used to decode .pack file's database data which can be found in [rpfm-schemas](https://github.com/Frodo45127/rpfm-schemas).

```sh
bun tauri build
```
